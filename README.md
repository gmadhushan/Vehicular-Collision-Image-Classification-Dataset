# Vehicular-Collision-Image-Classification-Dataset
This repository contains the Vehicular Collision Image Classification Dataset created from corwd-sourced dashboard camera videos containing on-road vehicular collisions.

It is a three-class image classification problem consisting of images belonging to "No Collision", "Collision" and "Collided" classes.
The vehicular collision image classification dataset consists of a total of 8931 images.
The training - validation - test data splits are formed with 70 % - 15 % - 15 % of images from the dataset.
The training and validation data consists of 2600 images for No Collision, 2490 images for Collision and 2500 images for Collided classes respectively.
The test data consists of 390 images for No Collision, 374 images for Collision and 375 images for Collided classes respectively.

The Dataset can be downloaded from the following link.

# Vehicular-Collision-Image-Classification-Dataset
This repository contains the Vehicular Collision Image Classification Dataset created from corwd-sourced dashboard camera videos containing on-road vehicular collisions.

The Dataset can be downloaded from the following link.


The best performing image classification deep learning model built on MobileNet backbone using the Teachable Machine on this proposed dataset can be downloaded from the folder "Model".

Inference on the test data can be run using the "Inference.py" file.
